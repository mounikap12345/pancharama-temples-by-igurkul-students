          <h3 class="text-success">History</h3>
          <p>
            Maharaja Vasireddy Venkatadri Naidu, King of Chintapalli and later
            Dharanikota, was a great devotee of Amareswara. He expanded and
            renovated the temple. The popular legend has it that once during the
            course of putting down a rebellion in his land the King had to have
            recourse to a massacre of the Chenchus, whereupon he lost his mental
            peace, which he regained only when he came to Amaravati. He shifted
            his place from Chintapalli to Amaravati in 1796, and devoted his
            entire life, time and revenues to building temples for Lord Siva. He
            renovated the Amareswaraswamy temple here, engaged nine learned
            archakas for the daily archana of the Lord, and provided them with
            all the needs of livelihood, including 12 acres (49,000 m2) of land
            to each. The temple as it stands owes much to him. As per Legend,
            the demon king named Tarakasura defeated the gods after being
            awarded a boon by Lord Shiva. Shiva vowed to kill the demons and
            hence the gods came to reside here and since then the place came to
            be called Amaravati. Lord Shiva is worshipped as Amareswara with his
            consort Bala Chamundika, who is considered as the fourth of the 18
            goddesses.srikrishnadevaraya had visited this temple after the war
            of kodapalli.

          <h3 class="text-success">Architecture</h3>
          <p>
            Amaravati temple has also a wealth of inscriptions on its walls like
            those of the Kota chiefs of Amaravati and of Sri Krishandevaraya,
            the great Vijayanagara emperor. On a pillar in the Mukhamantapa the
            wife of Proli Nayudu, who was minister of Kota King Ketaraja, has
            left an inscription.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-success">Festivals</h3>
          <p>
            The main festivals in the temple are the <u>Mahashivaratri</u>,
            which comes in the Magha Bahula Dasami and the Navaratri and the
            Kalyana Utsavas. Amaravati is thus an important Kshetra situated at
            a particularly sacred spot of the holy river Krishna and is a
            consecrated place of worship, of importance to Hinduism.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-success">Renovation</h3>
          <p>
            The Gopuram of the temple is renovated as it developed cracks in
            masonry due to the passage of heavy equipment. It was rebuilt at a
            cost of Rs.1.56 crore. The former structure was renovated in 1796 by
            the local ruler Vasireddy Venkatadri Nayudu. During this renovation
            ancient artifacts dating back 1800 years were found in the
            Foundation pits.
