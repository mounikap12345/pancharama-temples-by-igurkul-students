        <h3 class="text-success">Etymology</h3>
        <div class="col-12">
          <p>
            The name Bhimavaram literally means "the gift of Bhima". According
            to a legend, in around 890-918 AD, an Eastern Chalukya king named
            Chalukya Bheema built a Siva temple and laid the foundation to this
            town. It was originally called "Bhimapuram", but the name gradually
            changed to "Bhimavaram"; "puram" refers to a dwelling place while
            "varam" means an endowment in Telugu. An alternative explanation is,
            that the sound va (labiodental) is preferred to ba, pa (labials) in
            colloquial language and over a period of time tend to shift from pa
            to va. Hence "varam" from "puram". Sri Bhimeswara Swamy aalayam was
            built between 890 & 918 CE by East Chalukya king named Chalukya
            Bhima. He is said to have laid the foundation for this temple and
            named the place Bhimapuram, which was later changed to Bhimavaram.
            Varam means something that is bestowed in Telugu. The temple was
            built by King Chalukya Bheema during 4th century. Shivalinga was
            installed by Moon God and hence the temple named as Somarama, as
            Sanskrit word soma means Chandra (God Moon). It is believed that the
            color of the Shivalinga changes according to the Lunar-rays.
