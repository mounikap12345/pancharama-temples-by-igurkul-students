          <h2 class="text-success">DRAKSHARAMAM</h2>
          <b>Draksharamam or Daksharamam (దక్షారామం)</b> is one of the five
          Pancharama Kshetras that are sacred to the Hindu god Shiva and also
          12th of Ashtadasha Shakthi Peetams. The temple is located in
          Draksharamam town of Konaseema district in the Indian state of Andhra
          Pradesh. Poet Mallikarjuna Panditaradhyudu who wrote first independent
          work in Telugu and who spread Veerasaivism in Andhra region during
          medieval ages was born in this town.
          <h2 class="text-success">Etymology</h2>
          The town was formerly known as Dhakshatapovana and Dhakshavatika. This
          is the place where Daksha head of all prajapatis did a yagna or yajna
          called <b>"Nireeswara yaga"</b> or <b>"Nireeswara yagna"</b>. This
          place's present name is a derivative of <b>"Daksha aaraama"</b> which
          means <u>"Abode of Daksha"</u>. This place was also referred to as
          Daksha vaatika by Jagadguru Shankaracharya/ Adi Shankara in maha
          shakti peetha sloka at <b>"Maanikye Daksha vaatika"</b> which points
          to <b>"Maanikyamba devi of Draksharama"</b>. The place where Daksha
          performed <b>"Nireeswara yagna"</b> is still visited by pilgrims here.

        <h2 class="text-success">History of the temple</h2>
        <div class="col-lg-12">
          <p>
            Inscriptions in the temple reveal that it was built between the 9th
            and 10th centuries CE by the Eastern Chalukyan king, Bhima. The big
            Mandapam of the temple was built by Ganga Mahadevi, daughter-In-Law
            of Eastern Ganga Dynasty king Narasingha Deva I of Odisha.
            Architecturally and sculpturally, the temple reflects a blend of
            Chalukyan and Chola styles. The temple is historically prominent. It
            was built by Eastern Chalukyas who reigned over this area. It's
            believed to have been constructed earlier to the Bhimeswaraswamy
            temple in SamarlaKota that was built between
            <b>892 C.E. and 922 C.E</b>.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-success">Legend</h2>
          <p>
            Daksharamam is considered to be the place where Daksha Yagnam
            happened. Lord Siva sanctified the place after the rampage and
            carnage carried out at the place by Lord Veerabhadra.
